# 3D houses from LiDAR data

In this project, the goal is to create a #D plot of a house, anywere in Flanders.

## About the data
The data that is used is sourced from the second edition of the “_Digitaal Hoogtemodel Vlaanderen_” ([DHMV II](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/producten-diensten/digitaal-hoogtemodel-dhmv)) from AGIV. 
It consists of

## Technical details
### Retrieving the address
In order to go further, we first need to connect a coordinate to a given address.
For Flanders, there are two public APIs that provide this service: [api.basisregisters.vlaanderen.be](https://docs.basisregisters.vlaanderen.be/docs/api-documentation.html#tag/api-documentation.html) and [loc.geopunt.be/location](https://loc.geopunt.be/).
Because the former returns more detailed results about the address, which include surrounding polygons for the building, I chose that one. 
However, the Geopunt API handles arbitrary lookup strings like “_Street name 11 City_”, so I added a function so that the user can add an address starting from a search string, using this API.

All the address-related code is in the class `Address`. 
On initialization the user specifies the address 

### Preparing the LiDAR data


### Creating a 3D plot
I used Matplotlib for the 3D plots. 


## How to use
There is an **example** plot in [a Jupyter Notebook](Example.ipynb). 

The **basic steps** to get to plotting are:
  1. Retrieve the address with an `Address` object. This can be done by filling in the `street`, `number` and `zipcode`/`municipality` arguments. Or, with a small sidestep, you can use the classmethod `Address.from_search()` to look up a more arbitrary address string.
  2. Create a `Building` object, with this address. The class handles then all the data internally, i.e. 

     - finding the right _Kaartbladversnijding_ zone,
     - checking if the GeoTIFFs are available locally
     - downloading them if needed, 
     - masking 

  3. 


There are also some unit tests, mainly for address lookups, in [tests.py](tests.py). Run with 
```sh 
python -m unittest tests.py
```

### Necessary packages
This project uses 

The easiest way to get this working is with a new Anaconda environment.
```conda create houses ```
